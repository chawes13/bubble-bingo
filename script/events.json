The exercise part is for TIME, not distance. We all end up at the same place, at the same time.</p> <p>Why do we go to Hashbrowns? Why don't you go someplace different every week like [insert other running group here]?</p> <p>1) I'm stupid lazy and just can't be bothered to go somewhere different every week. 2) Hashbrowns gives us the VIP treatment - we don't wait for a table, it's preset; we don't have to fumble around for cash to split out a huge bill, they split our checks. 3) If it ain't broke, don't fix it, just tip the server who makes all this convenience possible.</p> <p>To receive CANCELLATION notifications, you MUST be subscribed to Organizer Messages.

The host will have a conversation with attendees who may be a better fit with one of the other levels. We do our best to create even teams so that games are well-matched. There are no referees, so players need to play with sportsmanship and make their own calls. We aim to make everyone feel welcome at these events.</p> <p>Facility Information<br/>Windy City Fieldhouse is located at Logan and Western. It has several courts for different sports. Make sure you check which court we are playing on listed in the \"how to find us\" section above.</p> <p>Transportation<br/>There is free parking in the parking lot along the side of Windy City Fieldhouse and in the Target parking garage!

        "<p>Get out on a boat for the perfect Sunday afternoon and catch breathtaking views of the Chicago skyline with 400 people! There's literally nothing better than riding a yacht out onto Lake Michigan to soak up a warm summer day, and this is absolutely the least expensive (yet still amazing and nice) way to do it!</p> <p>I got them to hook us up with cheap tickets for this day, and we can get tickets starting at JUST $10 with promo code 'S3'! (full price is normally $50) BUT our code becomes worth less and the price goes up as more are sold so get yours ASAP. They ALWAYS sell out well before we hit the water.</p> <p>Use code 'S3' for our exclusive discount and get your tickets here:</p> <p>Tickets include: Your boarding pass, a live DJ, Giveaways &amp; Dancing of course! There will be several full cash bars on board.</p> <p>Boarding begins at 12:15 pm and sets sail at 1:00 pm sharp. Be on time so the boat doesn't leave without you!</p> <p>These boats always fill up so our group's RSVP number won't show how many are actually coming. There's always super fun and friendly people on board, and Meetup groups hang out on the top deck to be social and meet others, so it's a really fun environment :)</p> <p>---------------------------------------</p> <p>FAQs:</p> <p>What is the dress code? There is NO Dress code for the boat.</p> <p>Can I bring my own food/drink on the boat? Absolutely no outside food or beverage may be brought on the boat.</p> <p>What do I need to bring to get on the boat? Your printed ticket from Eventbrite and a valid ID. All guests must Be 21+.</p> <p>How do I get to the boat? Please see the ticket page for a map and a detailed list of directions.</p> <p>What kind of music will be played on the boat? The DJ will start with Top40, EDM, and Hip-hop and will play a variety of music with the goal of helping everyone enjoy themselves.</p> <p>WHERE TO BOARD THE BOAT AND HOW TO GET THERE: There are TONS of directions on how to get there, where to park, etc, etc, etc, on the ticket page so check it out there!</p> <p>---------------------------------------</p> <p>GET YOUR TICKETS BEFORE THE PRICE GOES UP AS MORE ARE SOLD!!</p> <p>Use code 'S3' for our exclusive discounted tickets starting at $10 and get em here:</p> ",

        "<p>THE HOUSE OF MIRTH<br/>By Edith Wharton</p> <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning American author Edith Wharton used her inside knowledge of upper class New York life in the early part of the 20th century as the basis for her 1905 novel, “The House of Mirth”. The novel is the classic and tragic portrayal of Lily Bart, an intelligent New York socialite during the Victorian era, who seeks to secure a husband and a place in the society life of New York’s upper class. Lily, who was raised to strive for a socially and economically prosperous marital union, finds herself at the edge of thirty, her youthful beauty fading and her matrimonial prospects dwindling. The novel follows Lily’s descent down the social ladder over a period of two years as she circles the margins of New York’s upper class drawing closer to what seems an inevitable loneliness. Central to the theme of the novel is how the Victorian era offered women relatively few other alternatives to achieve upward social and economic mobility than through marriage. A classic depiction of a bygone era, “The House of Mirth” is at once a detailed portrait of New York society life and a social satire which harshly criticizes the moral failings of the rich.</p> <p>Paperback, 351 pages; first published June 12th 1905. (CA)</p> ",

        "<p></p> <p>Live reading of Hans-Hermann Hoppe's Theory of Socialism and Capitalism (reading every 3-5 pages and then stopping for discussion). We will cover chapter:</p> <p>****Chapter 7: The Ethical Justification of Capitalism and<br/>Why Socialism Is Morally Indefensible . . . . . . 147*****</p> <p>Free ebook and description</p> <p></p> <p>Here is Hans Hoppe's first treatise in English — actually his first book in English — and the one that put him on the map as a social thinker and economist to watch. He argued that there are only two possible archetypes in economic affairs: socialism and capitalism. All systems are combinations of those two types. The capitalist model he defines as pure protection of private property, free association, and exchange - no exceptions. All deviations from that ideal are species of socialism, with public ownership and interference with trade.</p> <p>Within the structure of socialism, he distinguishes the left and right version. \"Conservative\" socialism favors high regulation, behavioral controls, protectionism, and nationalism. The \"liberal\" version tends more toward outright public ownership and redistribution.</p> <p>The consequences of socialism vary based on their degree and kind, but they have similarities: high costs, resource waste, low growth.</p> <p>Additionally,</p> <p>The second part of the book also introduces Hoppe's Argumentative Ethics, which is in my opinion, the most revolutionary development in the history of ideas.</p> ",

        "<p>Spring time is here! Just as daffodils break ground and move upward and outward, so does liver qi move in the body. If our liver qi is unbalanced, this movement will cause irritation, anger and bad moods. Also common are headaches at the top of the head, elevated blood pressure and tendon problems. In this series we will cleanse and strengthen the liver, and promote blood circulation to encourage free and smooth flowing qi.</p> <p>The health of the liver affects the level of qi in the body. It stores and detoxifies the blood and maintains the efficient circulation of qi, influencing emotions, metabolism, and free flow of blood. The tendons and sinews are impacted, controlling movement of the limbs. The eyes are the opening of the liver allowing for clear crisp vision, and manifests in the nails. When liver qi is smooth there is a sense of purpose and direction in life, and the ability to make decisions.</p> <p>We will end with a sound healing meditation, using Himalayan singing bowls.</p> <p>Cost $18<br/>or<br/>try $20 for 2 weeks, and exlpore other class offerings!</p> <p></p> ",

You can arrive as early as 6:30 to warm up. For maximum playing time, we will try to start as close to 7:00pm as possible.</p> <p>Attendance:</p> <p>Some of our meetups get full quickly. If you cannot make it, please update your RSVP so that players on the waitlist can get a spot. Not showing up to 3 games that you have RSVP's \"yes\" to will result in your removal of the meetup. Finding us:</p> <p>We have neon green flag at the top of our net. We also have fabric wrapped around our poles. Anna G. will be hosting.</p> <p>Weather:</p> <p>In the case of rain, I will cancel the meetup no later than 40 minutes before the games start.</p> <p>Getting there:</p> <p>- There is some free parking for those who drive. A metered parking lot is close too.</p> <p>-It is CTA accessible for those who don't drive. However, it is a bit of a walk from the bus stop to the volleyball courts. Give yourself about 8 to 10 minutes of time.</p> <p>After :</p> <p>More fun and socializing continues at the The Dock , located directly on the beach.</p> <p>See you all on the sand!</p> ",

      "description": "<p>• What we'll do<br/>To commemorate the bicentennial of Emily Brontë's birth on July 30, 2018, I hope you can join us in discussing Wuthering Heights.</p> <p>Wuthering Heights is Emily Brontë's only novel. Written between October 1845 and June 1846, Wuthering Heights was published in 1847 under the pseudonym \"Ellis Bell\"; Brontë died the following year, aged 30. Wuthering Heights and Anne Brontë's Agnes Grey were accepted by publisher Thomas Newby before the success of their sister Charlotte's novel, Jane Eyre. After Emily's death, Charlotte edited the manuscript of Wuthering Heights, and arranged for the edited version to be published as a posthumous second edition in 1850.</p> <p>Although Wuthering Heights is now widely regarded as a classic of English literature, contemporary reviews for the novel were deeply polarised; it was considered controversial because its depiction of mental and physical cruelty was unusually stark, and it challenged strict Victorian ideals of the day regarding religious hypocrisy, morality, social classes and gender inequality.</p> <p>--From Wikipedia.</p> <p>Online text:</p> <p>",

Le Guin has produced a stunning tour de force - the spellbinding story of Shevek, a brilliant physicist who single-handedly attemps to re-unite two planets cut off from each other by centuries of distrust.</p> <p>Anarres, Shevek's homeland is a bleak moon settled by an anarchic utopian civilization; Urras, the mother planet, is a world very similar to Earth, with its warring nations, great poverty, and immense wealth. Shevek risks everything in a courageous visit to Urras - to learn, to teach, to share. But his gift becomes a threat...and in the profound conflict which ensues, Shevek must re-examine his philosophy of life.</p> ",

      "description": "<p>Come join the American Red Cross as we help distribute food to Veterans at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center food pantry.</p> <p></p> <p>The VA food pantry operates on the vision of Veterans helping Veterans. Many of the Veterans at this pantry are homeless or disabled. This is your opportunity to show kindness and express gratitude to the brave men and women who served and sacrificed for our country.</p> <p>The Mission: To honor and support those who have served our country by improving Veteran's access to nutritionally adequate food and by providing a place for continued social contribution.</p> <p>Vision: Our goal is to alleviate hunger within the Veteran community and create a Veteran volunteer force with civic pride and comradery.</p> <p>We will meet at The Jesse Brown VA medical center at <b>8 AM</b> to setup tables and food. <b>This pantry runs on a very tight schedule. All volunteers must report in by 8:15 A.M. to receive your assignment or else you may not be able to participate.</b>  <b>Please allow yourself an extra 15 minutes to park and walk to the pantry area of the big building complex.</b></p> <p>If you take public transportation, the Damen bus stops right in front of the building at 820 S. Damen Ave.  From the main entrance, follow the blue signs to get to the Ogden elevators, then go up to the second floor, and then follow the brown signs to the Damen Pavilion. We will meet and setup in the main corridor.   If you drive, you can use their paid garage and get free parking validation after the event via the Volunteer Services office on the 4th floor. Entrances to the parking garage is on Taylor street and Ogden Ave.</p> <p><b>No open toe shoes allowed for safety reasons.  Wear non slip bottom shoes like sneakers please. Volunteers will be given gloves to use when handling non packaged food. </b></p> <p>The Greater Chicago Food Depository will supply the food and volunteers get to unbox, sort, and arrange the food to tables.  We will then provide assistance to Veterans that wants help as personal shoppers. The food pantry opens at 11 AM to 1 PM. After the event, we will then help close down the pantry, break down and recycle boxes, and pack any left over food onto a van to help another homeless shelter near by.</p> <p>This is a self select food pantry. The Veterans will have a choice to pick what food they want. Volunteers will help as personal shoppers, as many Veterans will have physical disabilities and your help will be much appreciated. This is also an opportunity to get to know them and share kind words with them. After all the Veterans have been served, we will help clean up and break down boxes for recycling. We should wrap up by 1:00 PM or maybe earlier.</p> <p>If you are a Veteran or know of any Veteran that needs help with food supplement, please let them know of this  service at the Jesse Brown VA medical center.</p> <p>The Jesse Brown Veterans Food Pantry, is a partnership between the Greater Chicago Food Depository, AmeriCorps, and the Jesse Brown VAMC. The pantry is one of the first programs of its kind offering Veterans a \"Client Choice\" model pantry. Client choice is a model of food distribution that enables Veterans to select their own food, much like a grocery store. Unlike most pantries, which provide clients with fixed boxes or bags of food with no ability to select the items included, client choice pantries allow clients the ability to choose from a wide variety of foods, better enabling clients to meet their personal dietary needs. Client choice also ensures a sense of dignity for clients and their families, higher satisfaction with the food they are able to choose, less waste, and greater opportunities for volunteers and clients to interact with the mission and vision of the organization in mind.</p> <p></p> <p>The American Red Cross exists to provide compassionate care to those in need. Our network of generous donors, volunteers and employees share a mission of preventing and relieving suffering, here at home and around the world, through five key service areas: Disaster Relief, Supporting America’s Military Families, Health and Safety Training, Lifesaving Blood, and International Services. For more information, please visit </p> <p><</p> <p><b>Transportation and Car pooling:</b>  We encourage our volunteers to be green whenever possible or practical. Public transportation (bus, train, bike, walking) are easy at many locations, but other sites are remote or end late at night and can use some car pool planning. If you do not drive and need a ride, post below and ask about car pool possibilities. State what town and intersection you can be picked up. If you do drive, please consider helping a fellow volunteer that lives near you or along your way. Post where you are coming from and offer to pick up a fellow volunteer along your route. You will make some new cool friends even before you get to the volunteer event.</p> <p><b>Honor your RSVP commitment: </b> Keep your RSVP status up to date. Event organizers depend on an accurate volunteer count to plan their assignments correctly. If you RSVP Yes to help an event, please honor your commitment and attend the event to help. Arriving on time and staying for the full duration of the volunteer shift is expected, unless stated by organizer that shift time is flexible, and you emailed ahead to both agree on a different time. Most events have limited volunteer spots; don't waste one by being a no-show. All event hosts are grateful for volunteers' help and will try to accommodate your schedule if you are sincere in helping.</p> <p>You have the option to change your RSVP to \"No\" if you no longer can attend. We understand volunteers also have jobs, school, and family, and unexpected things happen. Please cancel with at least 48 hours notice before the event time so other volunteers on the waiting list can have enough time to adjust their own schedule to participate.  Don't wait until the last day to cancel on an event, unless it is serious emergency. If you are sick with a cold of flu, then of course stay home to rest and recover. Taking care of your health is important. Going to an event when you are sick will only spread your germs and get more people sick. Most of the people we serve are vulnerable populations with a weaken immune system (seniors, children, homeless).  We must be mindful to keep them safe and healthy.</p> ",

      "description": "<p>This talk is for you if zero or more of the following apply:</p> <p>1. You have heard about HDF5, and you are intrigued.<br/>2. You are interested in high-performance DAQ, and always wanted a C++ HDF5 SDK that was fit for purpose.<br/>3. A (Python) pickle-like mechanism to serialize C++ objects never gets off your Someday/Maybe list.<br/>4. You are passionate about creating usable C++ language bindings for non-(C++)-native APIs.<br/>5. You are just looking forward to another Chicago C/C++ Users Group meeting.</p> <p>HDF5 has been described as the world's most powerful data container for The Complex, The (Rapidly) Changing, and the Indeterminate. There are bindings for the native HDF5 API in most programming languages and often several high-level APIs. On reflection, C++ stands out as a language where the (published) results to date seem disproportionately modest, given the number of attempts at high-level APIs it's seen and given its importance as a language in the ecosystem. (Hint: It's not C++'s fault.)</p> <p>In this talk, we outline a fresh approach based on five values: parsimony, idiomaticity, openness, performance, and productivity. Departing from a \"continuation of C by other means\"-mentality and by embracing C++11(+) thinking, we believe to have created a framework that can rival the productivity and convenience of other offers without sacrificing application performance, and to do so while remaining inter-operable with third-party libraries.</p> <p>You be the judge!</p> <p>The HDF Group is a non-profit organization with a mission and a tradition spanning almost three decades. Our mission is to advance state-of-the-art open source data management technologies, to ensure long-term<br/>access to the data, and to support our dedicated and diverse user community. We do this by ensuring the creation of high quality software that addresses user needs and takes advantage of innovations in data<br/>management. The HDF Group is the developer of HDF5®, a high-performance software library and data format that has been adopted across multiple industries and is the de facto standard in the scientific and research communities.</p> ",

      "description": "<p>We spend so much time each day on what we “do” in our lives without really knowing why and then wonder about our sense of dissatisfaction. Think about the things you have done to make your life different with mixed results. You wish things were different, you want changes, you may even do affirmations or set goals, and still find you have little impact. No matter how much we wish, we haven’t really decided to make things different. We haven’t made what Dr. Judith Wright calls our One Decision. It’s a fundamental decision about how you want to live your life.</p> <p>In this interactive and engaging workshop, you’ll learn about the power of the One Decision, and how it can transform how you orient to your day—and get the results you desire. The One Decision is the magic formula that will help you break through old patterns. With the One Decision, in any situation, at any time, you can orient to your deeper yearnings and find more in all areas of your life, because you are living a life of purpose.</p> <p>Led by Dr. Judith Wright, this workshop will:</p> <p>Be a powerful tool for making the smallest decisions in all of your life.</p> <p>Decrease drama in your day to day interactions</p> <p>Have a guide for making big, momentous decisions, such as which job is right, what house to buy, or what relationship to commit to.</p> ",
